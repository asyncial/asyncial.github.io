      <description>I come across a lot of material to learn about computers, porgramming, software etc. on the Internet. Sadly more than I could possibly read&amp;hellip; However I think learning and teaching are integral parts of being a hacker in the traditional way. On this page I want to share articles, books, videos, wikis and talks that helped me or were interesting in some way to me and are of no cost.</description>

      <description>This blog documents my adventures in technology. At the moment my primary interest lies is linux/unix systems, their usage, their customization, their history and philosophy. But I am interested in other fields too, such as hardware, robotics, A.I., gaming and more. I hope you are going to enjoy this blog.
whoami I am a computer science student. I like (in no particular order) *NIX, minimalism, the GPL, AMD, Sony, Deus Ex, Risen, XCOM and Civilization, i3-gaps, the Raspberry Pi, Alpine Linux and more, what I don’t recall at the moment.</description>
