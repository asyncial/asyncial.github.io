      <title>Plan 9 -&gt; Linux</title>

      <description>Plan 9 from Bell Labs is one of the more interesting operating systems out there. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it interesting to find software, that is in some way inspired by Plan 9 on other operating systems. So, to document what I find on this, I decided to make a list of Plan 9 inspired Linux programs.
Ports This category gets the straight-up ports of Plan9 programs to Linux/Unix out of the way, before going further.</description>

      <description>english version below
Informatik scheint ständig im Wandel. Sieht man genauer hin, ist viel unhinterfragbar in Stein gemeißelt. Von ganz technischen Dingen, wie zum Beispiel die Fixierung auf x86 und ARM als Befehlssatzarchitekturen für so lange Zeit (inzwischen stellt RISC-V hier doch manches in Frage), über UNIX/POSIX/Linux als extrem dominantes Betriebssystem (so dominant, dass inzwischen selbst Windows eine Kompatibilitätsschicht implementiert), bis hin zu Art der Verwendung von Computern, etwa die Fixierung auf Text und die Trennung der Nutzer in Programmierer und Konsumenten.</description>

      <title>Backup your current Vivaldi session automatically</title>

      <description>As you might know, I use Vivaldi. I really like it, because I think, it is a quite flexible window manager. I can have tens and hundreds of tabs open, but I can sort them, group them, view them as a tree, even tile them. Vivaldi has a downside though. It is not exactly the most stable browser on my system. So, from time to time, Vivaldi crashes and loses all my tabs.</description>

      <title>Speed up URxvt</title>

      <description>This blog post documents really quick, how you can get URxvt to be ready in less time. I measured the time, my computer needed, to start instances of URxvt to a usable shell and close it again for 25 times. I tried that with bash, dash and zsh with and without oh-my-zsh. It measured it with time(1). My test script looks like this:
#! /bin/sh for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 do urxvt -e &#39;dash&#39; done Of course, &amp;lsquo;dash&amp;rsquo; needs to be replaced with the shell, you want to use.</description>

      <title>The Status of the Qt desktop</title>
      <link>https://asyncial.github.io/blog/the-status-of-the-qt-desktop/</link>

      <description>In the last few years, Qt-based desktop environments became more and more popular. There are quite a lot of them now. Of course, we have the old, trusty KDE, now in version 5.10, as &amp;ldquo;flagship&amp;rdquo; of the Qt crew, but there are more. LXQt as the lightweight choice, which is a fusion between LXDE and Razor-Qt, the highly experimental Liri, trying to implement a very modern looking desktop, very similar to Google&amp;rsquo;s Material Design, the &amp;hellip; different DE, called theShell, of course Lumina mainly targeted at *BSD, but of course portable enough, to run on Linux too, and Budgie is going to be Qt-based in the future as well!</description>

      <title>organize your .xresources</title>

      <description>If you are anything like me, you like to customize your terminal colorscheme. And if you are even more like me, you are using urxvt and need to edit your ~/.Xresources to changes your terminals colors. So I assume your .Xresources are mess and you want to know, how to get them clean and easy to read and customize. If you already have a working system, there is no need to change it.</description>

      <title>10 more distros</title>

      <description>I’ve looked at ten more Linux distros! Again, I have the urge to share my experiences with the ca. 15 different visitors my blog already had, because I guess, they are very interested in my texts here. Or they are not. I only know one of them, and I didn’t ask him. However, here is the list of the distros:
 Alpine Linux 3.4.3 Chakra Linux 2016.02 Ian Linux Mint Debian Edition 2 NixOS 16.</description>

      <description>In the last few weeks, I took a look at 17 different Linux distributions. Why? Because I had nothing else to do and thought it was interesting to see, how the different systems feel. For the first round of this, I looked more at out-of-the-box, beginner-friendly-ish distros, because I’m lazy. I don’t want to say something about all of these distributions, but only about those, which were interesting or special in some way.</description>

      <title>how to debrand your xperia z3</title>
      <link>https://asyncial.github.io/blog/how-to-debrand-your-xperia-z3/</link>

      <guid>https://asyncial.github.io/blog/how-to-debrand-your-xperia-z3/</guid>
      <description>When I got myself a new Z3 the other day, it had a T-Mobile software branding. I think, you know what that means: stupid bloatware and less chance to get updates. So I decided to get rid of it. That’s how you do it:
 Do a back up of your data! Get and install the Sony PC Companion, if you don’t already did. Get and install Flashtool. I recommend using the torrent link, because the download server was quite slow, when I tried it.</description>
